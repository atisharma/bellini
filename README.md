Champagne
=========

Champagne is a fork (well, a butchery) of [CAVA](https://github.com/karlstav/cava/) to provide more a 'scientific' spectrum analyzer.

Like CAVA, champagne's goal is to provide a audio spectrum analyzer for Linux from various inputs.

Unlike CAVA, champagne is meant for accuracy and correctness, and writes directly to the framebuffer for speed.

Champagne inherits CAVA's input support, so should work with Pulseaudio, fifo (mpd), sndio, squeezelite and portaudio.
